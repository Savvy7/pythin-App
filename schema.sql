Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.\n\nL.A.

When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe.\", \"developer\": \"Oddworld Inhabitants\", \"platforms\": [\"PlayStation 3\", \"PlayStation 4\", \"PC (Microsoft Windows)\", \"PlayStation 5\", \"DOS\", \"PlayStation\", \"PlayStation Portable\"], \"publisher\": \"GT Interactive Software\", \"franchises\": [], \"game_modes\": [\"Single player\", \"Multiplayer\"], \"collections\": [{\"id\": 223, \"name\": \"Oddworld\"}], \"game_engines\": [\"A.L.I.V.E.\"], \"release_date\": \"Oct 22, 2009\", \"total_rating\": 91.35528317162928, \"release_dates\": [{\"id\": 372137, \"human\": \"Oct 22, 2009\"}, {\"id\": 371818, \"human\": \"Sep 18, 1997\"}, {\"id\": 371819, \"human\": \"Sep 18, 1997\"}, {\"id\": 371820, \"human\": \"Dec 11, 1997\"}, {\"id\": 371825, \"human\": \"2001\"}, {\"id\": 371826, \"human\": \"Apr 15, 2010\"}, {\"id\": 371827, \"human\": \"Oct 22, 2009\"}, {\"id\": 371828, \"human\": \"Apr 15, 2010\"}, {\"id\": 371831, \"human\": \"Jun 13, 2022\"}, {\"id\": 371832, \"human\": \"Jun 23, 2022\"}, {\"id\": 645193, \"human\": \"1997\"}, {\"id\": 645194, \"human\": \"Nov 11, 1997\"}, {\"id\": 371833, \"human\": \"Jun 01, 2022\"}, {\"id\": 371834, \"human\": \"May 23, 2022\"}, {\"id\": 371835, \"human\": \"Jun 13, 2022\"}, {\"id\": 371836, \"human\": \"May 23, 2022\"}, {\"id\": 371837, \"human\": \"Jun 01, 2022\"}, {\"id\": 371838, \"human\": \"May 23, 2022\"}], \"weighted_rating\": 73.99326433290628, \"involved_companies\": [{\"id\": 178224, \"company\": {\"id\": 205, \"name\": \"GT Interactive Software\"}, \"developer\": false, \"publisher\": true}, {\"id\": 178226, \"company\": {\"id\": 311, \"name\": \"Digital Dialect\"}, \"developer\": false, \"publisher\": false}, {\"id\": 288416, \"company\": {\"id\": 727, \"name\": \"Oddworld Inhabitants\"}, \"developer\": true, \"publisher\": false}, {\"id\": 288417, \"company\": {\"id\": 727, \"name\": \"Oddworld Inhabitants\"}, \"developer\": false, \"publisher\": true}], \"total_rating_count\": 230}','Oddworld Inhabitants','GT Interactive Software','[\"Single player\", \"Multiplayer\"]','[\"Oddworld\"]','[]','[\"Action\", \"Science fiction\", \"Stealth\", \"Comedy\"]','[\"A.L.I.V.E.\"]',NULL,73.9933),(331,'Forza Horizon 5',141503,'//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ofx.jpg','Nov 09, 2021','[\"Xbox Series X|S\", \"PC (Microsoft Windows)\", \"PlayStation 5\", \"Xbox One\"]','[\"Racing\"]',85,'Your Ultimate Horizon Adventure awaits!

Advance Wars features more than 115 maps, a map editor, head-to-head play via link cable, and an easy-to-understand tutorial mode for beginners.\", \"developer\": \"Intelligent Systems\", \"platforms\": [\"Wii U\", \"Game Boy Advance\"], \"publisher\": \"Nintendo\", \"franchises\": [\"Wars\"], \"game_modes\": [\"Single player\", \"Multiplayer\"], \"collections\": [{\"id\": 335, \"name\": \"Advance Wars\"}], \"game_engines\": [], \"release_date\": \"Apr 03, 2014\", \"total_rating\": 92.05921597981636, \"release_dates\": [{\"id\": 101311, \"human\": \"Apr 03, 2014\"}, {\"id\": 101309, \"human\": \"Jan 11, 2002\"}, {\"id\": 101321, \"human\": \"Apr 03, 2014\"}, {\"id\": 101308, \"human\": \"Apr 03, 2014\"}, {\"id\": 201167, \"human\": \"2001\"}, {\"id\": 496299, \"human\": \"TBD\"}, {\"id\": 101310, \"human\": \"Nov 25, 2004\"}, {\"id\": 101307, \"human\": \"Sep 10, 2001\"}], \"weighted_rating\": 72.48582114413192, \"involved_companies\": [{\"id\": 223787, \"company\": {\"id\": 70, \"name\": \"Nintendo\"}, \"developer\": false, \"publisher\": true}, {\"id\": 223788, \"company\": {\"id\": 25077, \"name\": \"Intelligent Systems\"}, \"developer\": true, \"publisher\": false}, {\"id\": 226304, \"company\": {\"id\": 5163, \"name\": \"iQue\"}, \"developer\": false, \"publisher\": true}], \"total_rating_count\": 127}','Intelligent Systems','Nintendo','[\"Single player\", \"Multiplayer\"]','[\"Advance Wars\"]','[\"Wars\"]','[\"Action\", \"Science fiction\", \"Warfare\"]','[]',NULL,72.4858),(409,'Total War: Shogun 2',432,'//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2rpy.jpg','Mar 15, 2011','[\"Linux\", \"PC (Microsoft Windows)\", \"Mac\"]','[\"Real Time Strategy (RTS)\", \"Simulator\", \"Strategy\", \"Turn-based strategy (TBS)\", \"Tactical\"]',83,'In Total War: Shogun 2 you choose from one of 9 (10 with Ikko-Ikki dlc) clans, each with their own unique traits and skills and each with their own RPG-style warlord to lead them.\nUse a mixture of diplomacy, political manoeuvring, province building, research and special agents such as Ninja assassins or Geisha spies to get your enemies exactly where you want them.\nAn intuitive user interface and a lovingly-created, complex and detailed campaign map make it both easy and enjoyable to build and run cities, recruit and move troops and issue commands – both noble and dishonorable, all with the aim of mastering enemy forces and seizing their lands.','{\"id\": 432, \"name\": \"Total War: Shogun 2\", \"cover\": \"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2rpy.jpg\", \"genres\": [\"Real Time Strategy (RTS)\", \"Simulator\", \"Strategy\", \"Turn-based strategy (TBS)\", \"Tactical\"], \"rating\": 83.031240074588, \"series\": [\"Total War: Shogun\"], \"themes\": [\"Historical\", \"Warfare\"], \"summary\": \"In Total War: Shogun 2 you choose from one of 9 (10 with Ikko-Ikki dlc) clans, each with their own unique traits and skills and each with their own RPG-style warlord to lead them.\\nUse a mixture of diplomacy, political manoeuvring, province building, research and special agents such as Ninja assassins or Geisha spies to get your enemies exactly where you want them.\\nAn intuitive user interface and a lovingly-created, complex and detailed campaign map make it both easy and enjoyable to build and run cities, recruit and move troops and issue commands – both noble and dishonorable, all with the aim of mastering enemy forces and seizing their lands.\", \"developer\": \"The Creative Assembly\", \"platforms\": [\"Linux\", \"PC (Microsoft Windows)\", \"Mac\"], \"publisher\": \"Sega\", \"franchises\": [\"Total War\"], \"game_modes\": [\"Single player\", \"Multiplayer\", \"Co-operative\"], \"collections\": [{\"id\": 5273, \"name\": \"Total War: Shogun\"}], \"game_engines\": [\"TW Engine 3\"], \"release_date\": \"Mar 15, 2011\", \"total_rating\": 85.515620037294, \"release_dates\": [{\"id\": 136493, \"human\": \"Mar 15, 2011\"}, {\"id\": 136494, \"human\": \"Mar 15, 2011\"}, {\"id\": 136495, \"human\": \"Mar 15, 2011\"}], \"weighted_rating\": 72.47728387150073, \"involved_companies\": [{\"id\": 227, \"company\": {\"id\": 111, \"name\": \"The Creative Assembly\"}, \"developer\": true, \"publisher\": false}, {\"id\": 228, \"company\": {\"id\": 112, \"name\": \"Sega\"}, \"developer\": false, \"publisher\": true}, {\"id\": 96361, \"company\": {\"id\": 23, \"name\": \"Feral Interactive\"}, \"developer\": false, \"publisher\": true}], \"total_rating_count\": 190}','The Creative Assembly','Sega','[\"Single player\", \"Multiplayer\", \"Co-operative\"]','[\"Total War: Shogun\"]','[\"Total War\"]','[\"Historical\", \"Warfare\"]','[\"TW Engine 3\"]',NULL,72.4773),(410,'Black Myth: Wukong',136879,'//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8h3y.jpg','TBD','[\"Xbox Series X|S\", \"PC (Microsoft Windows)\", \"PlayStation 5\"]','[\"Role-playing (RPG)\", \"Adventure\"]',91,'Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology.

Even though set in Frank Herbert\'s famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.\n\nThe single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand.

Even though set in Frank Herbert\'s famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.\\n\\nThe single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole.
